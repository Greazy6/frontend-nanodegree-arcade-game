===============================



Hello players, we have very hard, simple, short, but repeatable game.

All you need to do is get to the water to win, but watch out their are crazy ladybugs on the prowl.

This game is a simple javascript program made for easy installation on any browers.

The place to get the file is on a account at github called greazy6 it was forked from a orginal version from Udacity.

The link to this dazzling game is http://greazy6.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/

After some keen devlepoment it has morphed into the crazy sensation it currently is.

The directions to play are left arrow goes left, right arrow goes right,up arrow goes up, down arrow goes down.

It's so simple.

Feel free to play.......until you just can't.
